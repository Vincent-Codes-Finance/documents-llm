Introduction  \\nFrom 2010 to 2015, a group of Russian  and Ukrainian  \\nhackers  illegally  breached  the IT systems  of several  large \\nnewswire  companies.  The hackers  accessed  earnings  an- \\nnouncements’  press releases  several  hours before their \\nscheduled  release  to the public and sold them to a select \\ngroup of traders.  This ring of traders  aggressively  traded \\nin the hours before the news was publicly  released  in or- \\nder to exploit  this private,  “inside” information,  which only \\nhad value for a few hours. We use this event, when nearly \\n90 0 0 earnings  announcements  were exposed  to potential  \\ninformed  trading  by traders  with limited  ability to smooth  \\ntheir trading,  as a natural  experiment  to study fundamen-  \\ntal questions  in market  microstructure.  \\nFirst, how do the fundamental  characteristics  of stocks \\nor the characteristics  of private  signals  affect an informed  \\ninvestor’s  choice of trading  strategy?  Classical  models  of \\ntrading  (e.g., Kyle, 1985; Kandel  and Pearson,  1995; Kim \\nand Verrecchia,  1997 ) predict  that insiders  trade more ag- \\ngressively  when the difference  between  the observed  stock \\nprice and the fundamental  value is larger and when the \\nsignal about a stock’s fundamental  value is more precise.  \\nThough  intuitive,  to our knowledge  these fundamental  pre- \\ndictions  have not yet been empirically  examined.  Indeed,  \\nto test how an informed  trader would choose  among  dif- \\nferent stocks, one needs a setting  such as ours, where it is \\npossible  to observe  a cross-section  of stocks about which \\nthe informed  trader had private  information  and could \\nchoose  to trade in different  stocks. In the case of the hack- \\ning scandal,  the traders  had access to a large number  of \\npress releases  but chose to trade only on a subsample  of \\nevents.  We are able to examine  the exact private  informa-  \\ntion that the traders  used to decide how to trade (the text \\nof the press releases).  Having  such information  allows us \\nto use machine  learning  methods  to measure  the strength  \\nand precision  of the traders’  signals  and to relate the char- \\nacteristics  of their signals  to their trading  decisions.  \\nSecond,  how much private  information  can a small \\namount  of informed  trading  reveal?  Existing  literature  sug- \\ngests that trading  can predict  news or subsequent  future \\nreturns  ( Kaniel et al., 2012; Collin-Dufresne  and Fos, 2015; \\nHendershott  et al., 2015 ). However,  quantifying  how much \\ninformation  is revealed  by informed  trades or the speed at \\nwhich this information  is incorporated  into prices is chal- \\nlenging.  Indeed,  one needs an ex-ante  quantiﬁable  source \\nof fundamental  news such as an earnings  surprise  as well \\nas a setting  in which there is plausibly  exogenous  varia- \\ntion in which traders  have access to the fundamental  news. \\nThe hacking  scheme  provides  such a setting  because  we \\ncan observe  a set of common  events (earnings  announce-  \\nments),  in which “informed  retail” traders  had access to \\n“inside” information about  some upcoming earnings an-  \\nnouncements’  press releases  but not about others. This al- \\nlows to isolate the impact  of insider  trading  to returns  rel- \\native to other factors known  to impact  returns  prior to \\nearnings  announcements.  \\nFinally,  do liquidity  providers  respond  to a sharp \\nincrease  in informed  trading?  Classic models  such \\nas Copeland  and Galai (1983) and Glosten  and Mil- \\ngrom (1985) suggest  that liquidity  providers  (market  makers)  widen spreads  when faced with an increased  \\nlikelihood  of informed  trading.  However,  recent empirical  \\nwork ﬁnds that spreads  and other measures  of adverse  \\nselection  are negatively  associated  with episodes  of in- \\nformed  trading  ( Collin-Dufresne  and Fos, 2015; Ahern, \\n2020; Kacperczyk  and Pagnotta,  2019 ). This negative  as- \\nsociation  is likely inﬂuenced  by informed  traders’  effort s \\nto split their trades across time to avoid detection,  which \\ninduces  an important  endogeneity  problem  when studying  \\nhow well market  makers  respond  to informed  trading.  \\nThe nature of the hacking  prevented  the hackers  from \\nmeaningfully  splitting  their trades across time as they only \\nhad a few hours to proﬁt from the information  before it \\nbecame  public. This natural  constraint  on strategic  timing \\nallows us to more directly  study how well market  makers  \\ncan respond  to aggressive  informed  trading.  \\nTo examine  these important  issues, we deﬁne a set of \\ntreatment  ﬁrms whose earnings  announcements  were ex- \\nposed to the hackers’  breach of a newswire  at a partic- \\nular point in time, and a control  group of ﬁrms whose \\nearnings  announcements  were not exposed  at that same \\npoint in time. In publicly  available  court documents,  the US \\ngovernment  alleges that there were at least several  hun- \\ndred cases of known  illegal trading  occurred  and that the \\nhackers  sold earnings  news on a black-market  website  ac- \\ncessed by more than 100 individual  traders.  Unfortunately,  \\nthe universe  of these trades is not available  for study, so \\nour primary  research  design focuses  on access to mate- \\nrial, non-public  information  rather than on the speciﬁc  in- \\nformed  trades. 1 We believe  that our analysis  estimates  a \\nlower bound of the effect of this illegal trading  on prices. \\nWe construct  measures  of hard and soft information  \\nthat reﬂect the information  content  of the earnings  press \\nreleases  to quantify  the information  set of the hackers.  \\nWe use the conventional  measure  of earnings  surprise  \\n( DellaVigna  and Pollet, 2009 ) to measure  “hard” informa-  \\ntion. We quantify  the “soft” information  of the press re- \\nlease using a machine  learning  technique  (ElasticNet)  on \\nthe text of the press releases  that scores each word in the \\npress release  to best explain  the price reaction  to the earn- \\nings announcement.  We ﬁnd that measures  of both hard \\nand soft information  explain  price reactions  by a similar  \\nmagnitude,  despite  only having a correlation  of about 15%. \\nWe use a sample  of earnings  announcements  that formed  \\nthe basis of the US prosecutions  to identify  a set of cases \\nwith known  informed  trading  and study which stock char- \\nacteristics  and types of information  were most correlated  \\nwith the hackers’  trading  decisions.  We ﬁnd that hackers  \\nwere more likely to trade when ﬁrms were larger, had \\nlarger analyst  coverage,  and had lower spreads,  as well \\nas for earnings  news that had both hard and soft signals  \\npointing  in the same direction.  Moreover,  trades on earn- \\nings news that had correlated  signals  had the largest gap \\nbetween  pre- and post-announcement  prices, suggesting  \\nthe hackers  correctly  identiﬁed  and traded when the gap \\nbetween  price and fundamental  value was the largest,  con- \\n1 We ﬁled several Freedom  of Information  Act requests with the SEC to \\nbetter reﬁne our analysis and to obtain the universe of potentially  illegal \\ntrades. All of these requests were denied. \\n1163 ', metadata={'source': 'hacking_prices.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Overnight  returns  of ﬁrms whose newswires  had been \\nhacked  are less responsive  to earnings  surprises  and the \\nsoft information  contained  in the text of the press releases,  \\nsuggesting  that prices had already  incorporated  some of \\nthe information.  Speciﬁcally,  we ﬁnd that the overnight  \\nreturn response  to a given earnings  surprise  and soft in- \\nformation  after the news has been released  are 15% and \\n16% lower, respectively,  if a ﬁrm’s earnings  release  had \\nbeen exposed  to hackers.  We also ﬁnd that price revela-  \\ntion was stronger  when the signals  of future fundamental  \\nvalue were more precise.  More speciﬁcally,  we show that \\nthe sensitivity  of overnight  returns  to earnings  surprises  \\n(soft information,  respectively)  is even smaller  for events \\nthat were subject  to a hack when the magnitude  of the soft \\ninformation  (earnings  surprise,  respectively)  is higher.  We \\ninterpret  this as evidence  that the hackers  traded most ag- \\ngressively  on more precise  signals,  and in so doing moved \\nprices the most for those events.  This is consistent  with \\nthe predictions  of models  in which informed  traders  trade \\nmore aggressively  when they can better forecast  future \\nfundamental  values (e.g., Kandel  and Pearson,  1995; Kim \\nand Verrecchia,  1997 ). \\nHaving  established  that the hackers’  trading  was suﬃ- \\nciently large to impact  price discovery,  we use this scheme  \\nas a laboratory  to study the relationship  between  informed  \\ntrading  and spreads.  We ﬁnd that equity volume,  equity \\nturnover,  and option volume  were higher when a ﬁrm’s \\nearnings  were subject  to informed  trading.  Moreover,  we \\nﬁnd that effective  and realized  spreads  are robustly  higher,  \\nsuggesting  liquidity  providers  charged  higher transaction  \\ncosts in response  to an aggressive  increase  in informed  \\ntrading.  Our results are consistent  with the predictions  of \\nmodels  such as Glosten  and Milgrom  (1985) , Easley and \\nO’Hara (1987) , and Kim and Verrecchia  (1994) , but dif- \\nfer from the results of previous  studies  that examined  \\nspreads  and informed  trading  when the informed  traders  \\nhad fewer constraints  on trade splitting  ( Collin-Dufresne  \\nand Fos, 2015; Kacperczyk  and Pagnotta,  2021 ). \\nOur study complements  recent papers that examine  the \\nrelationship  between  the distribution  of private  informa-  \\ntion to investors  and price formation.  Hu et al. (2017) and \\nRogers et al. (2017) study the market  response  to private  \\ninformation  at high frequency  for news that was privately  \\navailable  for paid subscribers  to different  news vendors  \\nthat provided  news a few seconds  before being released  \\npublicly.  They ﬁnd a fast price reaction  at the time the \\nnews was disclosed  to these subscribers.  In contrast  to \\nthese studies,  our empirical  tests study a large set of pri- \\nvate information  that was (illegally)  made available  to a \\nlimited  number  of retail traders.  Moreover,  we focus on a \\nset of retail traders  who are not capable  of processing  in- \\nformation  at microsecond  speed to “snipe” ineﬃcient  stale \\nquotes,  but instead  traded on private  information  through  \\ntheir personal  brokerage  accounts  over a few hours. 2 As in \\n2 Most of the traders involved in this illegal trading scheme were re- \\ntail traders who were members  of the hacker’s extended  families or their Hu et al. (2017) , we examine  how much of that private  \\ninformation  is reﬂected  in prices before announcements  \\nby examining  the conditional  mean response  of prices to \\nnews using an ex-ante,  well-deﬁned  measure  of surprise.  \\nIn contrast  to their study, we focus on a small set of \\nless technologically  sophisticated  individual  traders  (rather  \\nthan professional  funds, e.g., high-frequency  traders)  and \\nstudy ﬁrm-level  news (rather  than macroeconomic  news), \\nwhich also allows us to examine  how cross-sectional  char- \\nacteristics  of ﬁrms’ trading  and information  environments  \\nmatter for price discovery.  \\nOur study further  complements,  but is different  \\nfrom, several  recent papers that examine  how in- \\nvestors  trade when in possession  of private  information.  \\nKoudijs  (2015) uses data from the 18th-century  London  \\nand Amsterdam  markets  to identify  the time of arrival of \\nprivate  news (without  observing  the nature of the infor- \\nmation)  and supports  the hypothesis  that informed  agents \\ntrade as in Kyle (1985) . Kacperczyk  and Pagnotta  (2021) re- \\ntrieve a list of 453 cases of SEC investigations  about in- \\nsider trading  for which the authors  know the personal  \\nbackground  of the insiders  and their actual trades. 3 They \\nﬁnd that nearly 80% of insiders  split their trades as \\nin Kyle (1985) and are more likely to split when pri- \\nvate signals  are less powerful  and legal risks are higher.  4 \\nBolandnazar  et al. (2020) study the trade patterns  when \\na subset of investors  received  value-relevant  information  \\nfrom the SEC a few seconds  earlier than ﬁnancial  markets  \\nat large. They ﬁnd that informed  investors  traded more \\naggressively  when the expected  release  of the news was \\ncloser and when the value-price  divergence  is larger. Fi- \\nnally, Shkilko  (2018) concludes  that insiders  primarily  fo- \\ncus on return timing rather than liquidity  timing.  Our fo- \\ncus relative  to these papers is different  because  the hack- \\ners’ information  was short-lived;  in most cases, they knew \\nthe information  would become  public after the end of the \\ntrading  day. Thus, we do not test whether  traders  split \\ntheir trades over several  days as in Kyle (1985) , but rather \\nwe study whether  liquidity  providers  are capable  of widen-  \\ning spreads  when they are faced with a sharp increase  of \\ninformed  trading.  Such a mechanism  is central  to classical  \\nmodels  of market  making  (e.g., Copeland  and Galai, 1983; \\nGlosten  and Milgrom,  1985 ) and has, to our knowledge,  not \\nbeen systematically  documented  empirically.  \\nOur paper relates to recent literature  that exam- \\nines the performance  of insider  trading  measures.  Collin- \\nDufresne  and Fos (2015) and Kacperczyk  and Pag- \\nnotta (2019) both examine  how measures  of adverse  se- \\nlection  respond  to informed  trading,  either on days when \\nactivist  investors  take positions  in stocks or on days when \\nan insider  illegally  trades, respectively,  and ﬁnd that illiq- \\nuidity measures  are negatively  related  to stock-level  trad- \\ning by informed  investors.  They conclude  that informed  in- \\nsocial circles. They frequently  traded using their personal  brokerage  ac- \\ncounts. This pattern of an informed  network is similar to the ﬁnding in \\nAhern (2017) that insider information  ﬂows through strong social ties. \\n3 Only 15% of these cases concern trading before earnings  announce-  \\nments. \\n4 Several other paper papers study the role of legal risks on insider \\ntrading (e.g., Meulbroek,  1992; Garﬁnkel,  1997 ). \\n1164 ', metadata={'source': 'hacking_prices.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

Ahern (2020) makes a similar  point \\nand suggests  that understanding  the “urgency” of  informed  \\ntraders  to trade on their private  information  is crucial to \\ndetect their presence.  We complement  these studies  by \\nproviding  evidence  that liquidity  providers  can respond  to \\npotential  informed  order ﬂow by adjusting  prices and/or \\nspreads  when the ability of informed  traders  to time their \\ntrades is low, thus providing  empirical  support  for classical  \\nprice formation  models  where traders  anticipate  this be- \\nhavior and strategically  time their trades to minimize  price \\nimpact  (e.g., Glosten  and Milgrom,  1985; Kyle, 1985; Easley \\nand O’Hara,  1987; 1992 ). \\nOur paper also contributes  to the literature  that \\nstudies  the relevance  of non-numerical  data or \\ninformation  for ﬁnancial  markets.  Classic papers \\nsuch as Tetlock  (2007) , Hoberg  and Phillips  (2010) , \\nLoughran  and McDonald  (2011) , Dougal  et al. (2012) , and \\nBoudoukh  et al. (2019) show that textual  analysis  has \\na variety  of applications,  such as quantifying  sentiment,  \\nﬁrms’ products  and innovation,  and investor  attention.  \\nOther recent applications  of machine  learning  include  \\nmeasuring  banking  regulation,  corporate  culture,  and ﬁrm \\ninnovation,  among  many others (e.g., Goldsmith-Pinkham  \\net al., 2016; Grennan,  2019; Bellstam  et al., 2021 ). Sev- \\neral recent papers discuss  the diﬃculty  of deﬁning  soft \\ninformation  but highlight  that non-numerical  information  \\nis important  in many ﬁnancial  market  contexts  ( Liberti,  \\n2018; Liberti and Petersen,  2019; Blankespoor  et al., 2020; \\nBradshaw  et al., 2021; Gustafson  et al., 2021 ). Our paper \\nprovides  another  instance  in which textual  analysis  can \\nbe used to construct  a measure  of soft information  that \\nhas valuable  information  content  in the context  of insider  \\ntrading.  \\nFinally,  our paper contributes  to a new literature  that \\nexamines  the consequences  of cyberattacks  on ﬁrms and \\nﬁnancial  markets.  A number  of recent studies  examine  \\nthe causes and consequences  of individual  cyberattacks  on \\npublicly  traded ﬁrms (e.g., Akey et al., 2020; Kamiya  et al., \\n2021; Florackis  et al., 2020; Crosignani  et al., 2021; Huang \\nand Wang, 2021 ). Other studies  focus on the insider  trad- \\ning of individual  ﬁrms that are subject  to cyberattacks.  \\nMitts and Talley (2018) and Berkman  et al. (2019) discuss  \\npotential  insider  trading  of individual  ﬁrms that are subject  \\nto breaches  in cybersecurity.  In contrast  to these papers,  \\nwe study cyberattacks  on private  companies  that reveal in- \\nformation  about a wide set of other ﬁrms . Thus, our setting  \\nis unique  because  we can observe  the (stolen)  information  \\nset of informed  traders  and study how the price impact  of \\ntrades differs for different  types of ﬁrms or earnings.  5 \\n2. Empirical  setting:  The newswire  hacks \\nTo examine  the ability of informed  (retail) investors  to \\nimpact  price formation,  we must identify  one set of ﬁrms \\n5 Xie (2020) uses the same setting to study how informative  earnings  \\nannouncements  are. In contrast to her ﬁndings,  our results suggest that \\nthe hackers did gain informative  signals about future prices from press re- \\nleases and that there is valuable information  contained  in earnings  press \\nreleases. for which the informed  investors  have access to material  \\nnon-public  information  and one set of ﬁrms for which they \\ndo not have access to such information.  Moreover,  we must \\nbe able to both observe  the news and infer how the market  \\nwould react to the news. Hacked  newswires  and earnings  \\nannouncements  can plausibly  be used as such a setting.  \\nFirms communicate  earnings  and other corporate  news \\nto markets  through  one of several  newswire  companies.  \\nThey typically  contract  with (only) one company  to re- \\nlease news. Since the late 20 0 0s, a ﬁrm’s earnings  are typ- \\nically released  in the after-hours  market  ( Michaely  et al., \\n2014 ), when new information  about the ﬁrm’s value is \\ntypically  incorporated  in prices very quickly  ( Grégoire  and \\nMartineau,  2021; Martineau,  2021 ). Firms provide  earnings  \\nannouncements  to their newswire  service  several  hours \\nbefore news is to be released.  They are stored in the \\nnewswire’s  IT systems  until their prescheduled  release  \\ntime. This window  between  the earnings  news being up- \\nloaded to the IT systems  and their public release  is the \\nperiod when hackers  who have access to the information  \\nfrom the newswire’s  IT systems  could trade using this in- \\nformation.  Because  ﬁrms only contract  with one newswire  \\ncompany  and, as we will describe  in detail below, the \\nhackers  only had access to the IT systems  of some of the \\nnewswire  companies,  we have variation  in the non-public  \\ninformation  set that the hackers  could trade on (i.e., the \\nquantitative  earnings  ﬁgures and qualitative  discussion  in \\nthe press releases).  \\nBetween  2010 and 2015, a group of hackers  and indi- \\nvidual traders  (we refer to them collectively  as “the hack- \\ners” as  both the hackers  and traders  were prosecuted  for \\nillegal trading)  engaged  in a series of cyberattacks  against  \\nthe three largest newswires:  Business  Wire, Marketwired,  \\nand PR Newswire.  6 The hackers  used sophisticated  meth- \\nods to attempt  to penetrate  the IT systems  of these com- \\npanies.  They had varying  degrees  of success  with differ- \\nent newswires,  but obtained  access to the IT systems  of \\nMarketwired  continuously  from the beginning  of 2010 un- \\ntil the end of 2013, had intermittent  access to PR Newswire  \\nfrom 2010 to 2012, and had access to Business  Wire \\nfor half of 2015. This access allowed  the hackers  to ob- \\ntain company  press releases,  including  earnings  announce-  \\nments, after they had been sent by the client ﬁrm but be- \\nfore they were released  to the market.  \\nThe hackers  and many of their family members  or \\nmembers  of their social circles traded on the private  in- \\nformation  using a variety  of personal  brokerage  accounts  \\n(e.g., Interactive  Brokers,  Charles  Schwab,  and TD Amer- \\nitrade).  In addition,  they sold information  online to in- \\nvestors  that resided  in eastern  Europe.  We provide  an im- \\nage used by the SEC to prosecute  some of the hackers  of \\na “shopping  list” of  earnings  information  on which they \\nwanted  to trade in Figure A1 of the Internet  Appendix.  \\nTheir trading  strategies  were relatively  sophisticated.

In total, more than 20 individuals  were charged,  \\nalthough  those individuals  residing  in Ukraine  were not \\nextradited  to the United States. Those individuals  who are \\nnot still in Ukraine  have either pleaded  guilty or been con- \\nvicted and sentenced  to prison.  \\n3. Sample  description  and empirical  strategy  \\nWe retrieve  data from several  sources.  Daily stock re- \\nturns, overnight  (4 p.m. to 9:30 a.m.) returns,  trade vol- \\nume, and prices are from the Center for Research  in Se- \\ncurity Prices (CRSP).  Intraday  transactions  data (trades  and \\nquotes)  are extracted  from the Trade and Quote (TAQ) \\ndatabase  following  the procedure  in Holden  and Jacob- \\nsen (2014) . Institutional  ownership  data are from Thomson  \\nReuters  13-F and option turnover  data are from Option-  \\nMetric.  The earnings  announcement  sample  is from I/B/E/S \\nand newswire  information  is from Ravenpack.  Intraday  op- \\ntion transaction  data are from the CBOE Global Markets.  \\nWe provide  below detailed  information  on the earnings  \\nannouncement  sample  construction  and how we link each \\nannouncement  to its newswire  provider.  \\nOur earnings  announcement  sample  is from January  1, \\n2010 to December  31, 2015—the  period during which the \\nnewswires  were hacked.  We follow Livnat and Menden-  \\nhall (2006) and choose  stocks for which the earnings  an- \\nnouncement  date is reported  in Compustat,  the price per \\nshare is available  from Compustat  as of the end of the an- \\nnouncement  quarter  and is greater  than $1, the stock mar- \\nket capitalization  is greater  than $5 million,  and the stock \\nis listed on the New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE),  NYSE \\nAmex Equities  (rebranded  as NYSE MKT in May 2012), or \\nNASDAQ  with share code 10 or 11 in the CRSP. We then \\nselect the earnings  announcements  for stocks that have at \\nleast one analyst  forecast  in I/B/E/S in the 90 days prior \\nto the earnings  announcement  so as to be able to com- \\npute an earnings  surprise,  for a total of 62,851 earnings  \\nannouncements.  Because  the majority  of earnings  are an- \\nnounced  overnight,  we exclude  earnings  announcements  \\nthat occurred  during regular  trading  hours (2159 observa-  \\ntions). \\n7 Augustin  et al. (2019) show that traditional  insiders in the US also \\ntrade in the option markets before merger and acquisition  announce-  \\nments. We next assign earnings  announcements  to the \\nnewswire  company  that released  the earnings  press re- \\nleases to the public. We use Ravenpack’s  Press Release  \\n(PR) and Dow Jones (DJ) news edition  to complete  this \\ntask. 8 We merge each earnings  announcement  to their cor- \\nresponding  earnings  press release.  We drop earnings  an- \\nnouncements  for which we were not able to assign a press \\nrelease  (4545 observations).  We further  drop observations  \\nwith no intraday  returns  in the TAQ database  on the trad- \\ning day prior to the earnings  announcement  and with \\nno opening  price in the CRSP following  the earnings  an- \\nnouncement  (2140 observations).  We restrict  our analysis  \\nto announcements  that use one of the newswires  that was \\nsubject  to a hack at some point to further  ensure we are \\ncomparing  ﬁrms that are most similar.  In doing so, we \\nidentify  results primarily  based on the timing of when a \\nﬁrm’s newswire  was hacked.  Our ﬁnal sample  consists  of \\n43,687 earnings  announcements,  of which 8980 were ex- \\nposed to hacks. Figure 1 shows the number  of earnings  an- \\nnouncements  exposed  to hacks by newswire.  \\nWe calculate  the standardized  earnings  surprise  fol- \\nlowing  DellaVigna  and Pollet (2009) and Hartzmark  and \\nShue (2018) and deﬁne earnings  surprises  as \\nSur pr ise i,t = E P S i,t −E t−1 [ E P S i,t ] \\nP i,t−5 , (1) \\nwhere EP S i,t is the earnings  per share of earnings  an- \\nnouncement  i for a ﬁrm announcing  on day t, and \\nE t−1 [ EP S i,t ] is the expectation  of earnings  per share, mea- \\nsured by the consensus  analyst  forecast  in I/B/E/S.  We de- \\nﬁne the consensus  analyst  forecast  as the median  of all an- \\nalyst forecasts  issued over the 90 days before the earnings  \\nannouncement  date. If analysts  revise their forecasts  dur- \\ning this interval,  we use only their most recent forecasts.  \\nWe scale the surprise  by the ﬁrm’s stock price ﬁve trad- \\ning days before the announcement.  We further  winsorize  \\nat the 1st and 99th percentiles  to account  for the outliers  \\nin the surprise  distribution  (the kurtosis  of the raw sam- \\nple is 1459.87),  as is commonly  done in the literature  (e.g., \\nSkinner  and Sloan, 2002; Doyle et al., 2006 ). \\nPanel A of Table 1 presents  summary  statistics  for \\nour sample.  The variables  are the earnings  surprise,  abso- \\nlute value of earnings  surprise,  year-end  log market  cap- \\nitalization  (prior to earnings  announcement),  fraction  of \\nshares held by institutions,  number  of analyst  forecasts,  \\nlog Q-value,  9 the share turnover  (monthly  trade volume  \\nin dollars divided  by the market  capitalization),  and op- \\ntion turnover  (monthly  option trade volume  divided  by the \\nshares outstanding).  10 \\nThe goal of this study is to understand  the causal ef- \\nfect of the informed  trading  activity  of a group of small \\n8 We use the DJ edition for press releases missing from the PR edition. \\nRavenpack  warned us that for 2014, and 2015, Business  Wire press re- \\nleases are missing from the PR edition but are present in the DJ edition. \\n9 Using the corresponding  Compustat  variables,  Q-value is calculated  \\nas the ratio of ﬁrm value to the sum of physical capital (prcc _ f ×csho + \\nd ltt + d lc −act) /ppegt. \\n10 The share turnover  and option turnover  are calculated  on the month \\nprior to the earnings  announcement.  \\n1166 ', metadata={'source': 'hacking_prices.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

There are several  reasons  why \\nuncovering  this effect is challenging  empirically.  The ﬁrst \\nreason is that it is diﬃcult  to identify  a counterfactual  \\ntrade that had the same “news content” and  could have \\nhad informed  trading  but did not. For example,  many in- \\nsider trading  cases that were prosecuted  involve  trading  \\nnews related  to a merger  ( Kacperczyk  and Pagnotta,  2019; \\nAhern, 2020 ). Identifying  “similar” counterfactual  observa-  \\ntions for informed  trading  events in a given time period is \\ndiﬃcult  ( Meulbroek,  1992 ). The second  reason is that in- \\nformed  traders  may select the types of ﬁrms about which \\nthey become  informed.  They may do so for unobservable  \\nreasons  that relate to either the characteristics  of the ﬁrm \\nor its trading  environment,  in which case naïve ordinary  \\nleast squares  (OLS) regressions  will yield a biased esti- \\nmate. Third, in equilibrium,  informed  traders  likely strate- \\ngically time their trades so as to minimize  detection  ( Collin- \\nDufresne  and Fos (2015) and Ahern (2020) ), thus it is im- \\nportant  to ﬁnd news events that have an equal “urgency”\\nto trade. \\nWe believe  this hacking  and illegal trading  scandal  is a \\nuseful setting  to help overcome  many of these empirical  \\nchallenges.  Because  ﬁrms typically  only contract  with one \\nnewswire  company,  hackers  had access to material,  non- \\npublic information  of some but not all ﬁrms. Thus, we are \\nable to identify  variation  in the information  set of a group \\nof informed  traders  that is unlikely  to be related  to the un- \\nderlying  characteristics  of the ﬁrms. 11 This, combined  with \\nthe fact we only analyze  ﬁrm outcomes  on days before an \\nearnings  announcement,  means we have a counterfactual  \\nset of observations  (earnings  announcements  that were re- \\nleased by non-hacked  newswires).  Moreover,  because  the \\nhackers  only had a short window  (at most a few hours) \\nto trade on the information,  concerns  about strategic  trade \\ntiming are less salient in our setting.  \\nWe provide  evidence  of our identifying  assumption  that \\nthe pool of ﬁrms affected  by a hack of their newswire  \\nwas similar  to the pool of ﬁrms not affected  by a hack \\nin panels B and C of Table 1 . Speciﬁcally,  we regress  the \\ncharacteristics  reported  in panel A of Table 1 on a binary \\nvariable  that takes the value of one if a ﬁrm’s newswire  \\nhas been hacked  in that quarter  and zero otherwise.  Panel \\nB of Table 1 presents  the results of this analysis  in the \\ncross-section,  while panel C presents  within-ﬁrm  results.  \\nColumns  (1) and (2) consider  the raw and absolute  value of \\nﬁrms’ earnings  surprises.  There are no differences  between  \\nﬁrms that have a hacked  newswire  and those that do not. \\nColumns  (3)–(8)  present  ﬁrm fundamentals  and character-  \\nistics of their trading  environment.  In the cross-section,  we \\nﬁnd that ﬁrms subject  to a newswire  hack are smaller  and \\nhave less institutional  ownership,  but this difference  dis- \\nappears  once we introduce  ﬁrm ﬁxed effects as these vari- \\nables are quite persistent.  We ﬁnd no evidence  that the Q- \\n11 Our tests that examine the speed of price discovery  or market-making  \\ndo not condition  on the speciﬁc cases in which regulators  assert that \\nthere was informed  trading. Comparisons  of how eﬃciently  ﬁnancial  mar- \\nkets responded  to the hackers’ (endogenous)  choices of particular  stocks \\nto trade could reﬂect underlying  differences  (e.g., in liquidity)  between  \\ntraded and untraded  events. We show that such differences  are not \\npresent in hacked and unhacked  observations.  value is different  or that ﬁrms face different  information  \\nor trading  environments.  Firms that are hacked  have sim- \\nilar liquidity,  share turnover,  option turnover,  and analyst  \\ncoverage.  \\n4. How did the traders  select stocks?  \\nWe now examine  our ﬁrst research  question:  which \\ntypes of stocks or signals  did the hackers  prefer to trade \\non? Recent research  examines  the trading  behavior  of tra- \\nditional  insiders  such as managers  or directors  ( Ahern, \\n2020; Kacperczyk  and Pagnotta,  2021 ); however,  these in- \\nsiders likely only have infrequent  access to private  infor- \\nmation  and only about ﬁrms to which they have a con- \\nnection.  Because  the hackers  had access to the upcoming  \\npress releases  for any ﬁrm that used an affected  newswire  \\nand had sent in a press release  and they presumably  se- \\nlected individual  events for rational  reasons,  we can use \\nthis event as a laboratory  to examine  which type of pri- \\nvate information  is most “tradeable.” We  do so by exam- \\nining the characteristics  of the 724 events that formed  the \\nbasis of the US government’s  enforcement  against  the US- \\nbased traders  they were able to charge.  We do so in sev- \\neral steps. We ﬁrst identify  all of the days on which there \\nwas an informed  trading  event and construct  a sample  of \\nall earnings  announcements  released  on the same day to \\nidentify  the observations  the traders  could have traded.  \\nWe then split the observations  into three groups:  (1) earn- \\nings events that formed  part of the government’s  case and \\nfor which we are certain  that informed  trading  occurred,  \\n(2) earnings  events that were distributed  by a newswire  \\nthat was affected  by a hack at that point in time but did \\nnot form part of the government’s  case, and (3) earnings  \\nevents that were distributed  by a newswire  that was not \\naffected  by a hack at that point in time. We next examine  \\nwhether  fundamental  characteristics  such as size or liquid- \\nity are different  between  these groups  to study whether  \\nthe hackers  preferred  to trade certain  types of stocks. We \\nﬁnally study whether  the hackers  preferred  to trade on in- \\nformation  with more hard or soft information.  We proxy \\nfor hard information  using the earnings  surprise.  As we \\noutline  below, we conduct  textual  analysis  on the text of \\nthe press release  the hackers  accessed  to quantify  the soft \\ninformation  that they were able to read before the market  \\nat large. With measures  of hard and soft information  in \\nhand, we examine  whether  the hackers  were more likely \\nto trade on events with more extreme  realizations  of hard \\nand soft information.  We ﬁnally examine  how much more \\nproﬁtable  are the returns  of these events.  \\nBefore proceeding,  it is worth noting that we are only \\nable to observe  the subset of events described  in the \\ncourt documents;  we cannot observe  the universe  of all \\ninformed  trades by all of the traders.  This limitation  intro- \\nduces several  potential  biases. First, the US government  al- \\nleges a number  of traders  were based in Europe,  for whom \\nthey had no jurisdiction  for enforcement.  Thus, there are \\nlikely to be informed  trades that we cannot observe.  How- \\never, we believe  this would introduce  measurement  error \\nand potentially  bias comparisons  of known  events with \\nother events that were subject  to the hack downwards.  On \\nthe other hand, the government  chooses  which cases to \\n1168 ', metadata={'source': 'hacking_prices.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

To overcome  these potential  bi- \\nases, we compare  the prosecuted  observations  to both the \\nobservations  that were affected  by the hack and could have \\nbeen traded as well as the observations  that were not af- \\nfected by the hack and could not have been traded.  In \\ndoing so, we have two reference  groups:  (1) the events \\nthat the traders  could have traded but seemingly  did not \\n(but potentially  are subject  to a diﬃcult-to-sign  bias) and \\n(2) the events that the traders  could not have traded and \\nwhose characteristics  might be more representative  of the \\nunderlying  sample  characteristics.  \\n4.1. Firm fundamentals  \\nWe ﬁrst present  results examining  ﬁrm fundamentals  \\nbetween  the three groups  of stocks. Figure 2 presents  av- \\nerages and 95% conﬁdence  intervals  for all three groups  of \\nevents (i.e., events that were part of the US government’s  \\nenforcement,  events from the same day that were not part \\nof the enforcement  but were from a newswire  that was \\nhacked  on the day, and events from newswires  that were \\nnot affected  on that day). The stocks that were part of \\nthe prosecution  were larger as measured  by market  capi- \\ntalization,  were more liquid as measured  by lower quoted  \\nspreads  and higher institutional  ownership,  and were fol- \\nlowed by more analysts.  Moreover,  they were more fre- \\nquently  traded as measured  by monthly  share turnover  \\nand option turnover.  Finally,  the prosecuted  events gener- \\nally involved  more positive  surprises,  which we attribute  to \\nthe greater  cost associated  with taking short positions  (e.g., \\nas in Diamond  and Verrecchia,  1987; Marin and Olivier,  \\n2008 ). \\n4.2. Soft information  from press releases  \\nWe next quantify  the role of soft information  in the \\nhackers’  trading  decisions  using the target of the hacking  \\nscheme—the  press releases  themselves.  A typical press re- \\nlease contains  both quantitative  information  about realized  \\nsales and/or earnings,  often with a reference  to market  ex- \\npectations,  as well as more qualitative  information  similar  \\nto the management  discussion  and analysis.  We use ma- \\nchine learning  techniques  on the text of the press releases  \\nto quantify  positive  and negative  signals  of the expected  \\nprice reaction  to the news. More speciﬁcally,  we down- \\nload all press releases  from 2010–2015  from EDGAR  and \\nuse a machine  learning  algorithm  called ElasticNet  to iden- \\ntify which words can best explain  the stock return from 12 \\np.m. on the afternoon  before the earnings  are announced  \\nto the opening  of the morning  after the announcement.  \\nElasticNet  is a linear regression  model that blends both the \\nlinear and quadratic  penalties  used by LASSO and Ridge re- \\ngression  methods  in its objective  function  to identify  the \\nset of words that best explains  a dependent  variable  (i.e., \\nearnings  announcement  returns).  This speciﬁc  model per- \\nforms best in cases like ours where there is very high di- \\nmensionality  in the dependent  variables  (i.e., words in the \\npress releases)  and relatively  fewer independent  variables  (i.e., announcement  returns)  ( Zou and Hastie, 2005 ). We \\nrun this model on the ﬁrst 400 words of each press release  \\nin our sample  to assign a “score” to  each word so as to \\nbest explain  the reaction  to the earnings  announcement.  12 \\nThe ﬁtted value of the “best” model  is our measure  of soft \\ninformation.  13 We provide  word cloud ﬁgures that depict \\nboth the positive  and negative  words that contribute  most \\nto explaining  returns  in Fig. 3 , where larger sized words \\nhave larger explanatory  power for announcement  returns.  \\nThe words make intuitive  sense. “Rais ∗,” “exceed,” “mo-  \\nmentum,” “please  ∗, ”better,” and  “leverag  ∗”a r e some of \\nthe strongest  contributors  to positive  scores. “Disappoint  ∗,”\\n“challeng  ∗,” delay,” “weak,” “slower”,  “however,” “decline  ∗,”\\nand “lower” are  some of the strongest  contributors  to neg- \\native scores. \\nThe text of the press releases  has substantial  explana-  \\ntory power for the announcement  returns.  The univari-  \\nate R 2 of the best model is 0.068, which is comparable  \\nto the R 2 of the quantitative  earnings  surprise.  One may \\nbe concerned  that the press releases  are explaining  in \\ntext what can be understood  from the earnings  surprise  \\nor other quantiﬁable  information,  however  the univariate  \\nPearson  and Spearman  correlations  between  the two mea- \\nsures are only 0.15 and 0.20, respectively.  We present  fur- \\nther evidence  that this is not the case in Table 2 . In panel \\nA, we provide  a heatmap  of announcement  returns  af- \\nter double  sorting  by the earnings  surprise  and our mea- \\nsure of soft information.  Each row represents  an ordered  \\nquintile  of earnings  surprise  and each column  represents  \\nan ordered  quintile  of soft information.  Across both di- \\nmensions  of information,  returns  monotonically  increase  as \\nthe quintile  of soft or hard information  increases,  suggest-  \\ning both measures  of information  capture  different  infor- \\nmation.  We examine  this more formally  by running  re- \\ngressions  in which we separately  estimate  the explana-  \\ntory power of the earnings  surprise  and our measure  of \\nsoft information  and then estimate  the joint explanatory  \\npower. Panel B of Table 2 presents  the results of these \\nregressions.  In all regressions,  both the earnings  surprise  \\nand soft information  measure  are highly statistically  sig- \\nniﬁcant.  Individually,  the R 2 of the earnings  surprise  re- \\ngression  is 0.061, and the R 2 of the soft information  re- \\ngression  is 0.068, while the adjusted  R 2 of the regression  \\nthat includes  both variables  is 0.115; this suggests  combin-  \\ning the two measures  adds incremental  information  when \\nexplaining  returns.  Collectively,  these results suggest  our \\nmeasure  of soft information  captures  value-relevant  infor- \\nmation  that is not spanned  by the most commonly  used \\nmeasure  of quantitative  earnings  news. \\n4.2.1. Soft information  and stock selection  \\nWe now examine  whether  the hackers’  trading  deci- \\nsions used hard as well as soft information,  and whether  \\n12 In a typical earnings  press release, the ﬁrst few hundred words sum- \\nmarize the recent ﬁrm performance  and indicate the key factors underly-  \\ning the performance.  The remaining  content of the press release generally  \\nconsists of ﬁnancial  statements.  See Section 5.1.2 for robustness  analysis. \\n13 We provide a more detailed discussion  of the process that we used \\nto download  the data, the ﬁltering that we used to exclude words that \\nappear frequently  in most press releases, and the implementation  of the \\nmachine  learning algorithm  in Section A2 of the Internet Appendix.  \\n1169 ', metadata={'source': 'hacking_prices.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

Intuitively,  if the content  of the press releases  \\nis informative,  we would expect the hackers  would have been most likely to trade on events where there is a higher \\n“agreement” of  hard and soft information  (i.e., when both \\nthe earnings  surprise  and text of the press release  suggest  \\nprices should increase  or decrease).  \\nWe test this hypothesis  by ﬁrst splitting  the matched  \\nsample  that we used to look at fundamental  characteris-  \\ntics and prosecuted  trades by quintiles  on one dimension  \\nof information  (i.e., by hard information  or by soft infor- \\nmation)  and measure  the average  level of the second  di- \\nmension  of information  for the three categories  of observa-  \\ntions (i.e., a prosecuted  event, a same-day  event impacted  \\nby a hack but not a prosecuted  event, or a same-day  event \\nthat was not impacted  by a hack).

The \\nhackers  were more likely to select observations  when both \\nthe quantitative  earnings  surprise  and the qualitative  press \\nrelease  were most positive.  \\nWe next examine  whether  these trades also corre- \\nsponded  to the announcements  for which the gap between  \\nobserved  and fundamental  price is the largest by looking  at \\nthe announcement  returns  (12 p.m. to the next day open) \\nof the three groups  of events,  as would be expected  in \\nmodels  such as Kyle (1985) .

As both ﬁgures show, \\ntheir trading  decisions  were indeed  more proﬁtable.  The \\nreturns  for the negative-information  quintiles  that were \\nknown  to have informed  trading  were on average  lower \\nthan the returns  of events with similar  “levels” of  infor- \\nmation  but that were not known  to have informed  trad- \\ning, and vice versa for the positive-information  quintiles.  \\nIndeed,  as shown in panels C and D, the average  returns  \\nof the prosecuted  events with high levels of quantitative  earnings  surprise  (and correspondingly  high levels of soft \\ninformation)  had average  returns  of 4.4% and 3.3%, which \\ncan be compared  to 2.5% and 1.6% for the group of obser- \\nvations  that were subject  to the hack but not traded and \\n2.9% and 1.9% for the group of observations  that were not \\nsubject  to the hack, respectively.  Collectively,  we believe  \\nthese results suggest  the hackers  were more likely to trade \\nwhen they had hard and soft information  that pointed  \\nin the same direction,  thus reducing  risk associated  with \\ndifferential  interpretation  of the news by investors  at the \\ntime of the announcement  and focusing  on events that had \\nthe largest gap between  pre-announcement  price and fun- \\ndamental  value. \\n5.

As \\nwith the analysis  in panel A and the evidence  in Fig. 5 , \\nthere is a positive  and statistically  signiﬁcant  relationship  \\nbetween  the soft information  and the overnight  return as \\nexpected.  Consistent  with our previous  results,  we ﬁnd \\nthat returns  are less sensitive  to the soft information  in \\nthe press releases  when the newswire  that disseminated  \\nthem to the market  was subject  to a hack. We ﬁnd similar  \\nstatistical  and economic  results for the revelation  of soft \\ninformation  as for hard information.  For example,  in col- \\numn (4) we ﬁnd that prices were 15.7% ( = −0.210/1.334)  \\nless responsive  to our measure  of soft information  when \\nthe ﬁrm’s newswire  was subject  to a hack. In panel C, we \\ncombine  both types of information  and ﬁnd similar  mag- \\nnitude effects for the revelation  of hard and soft informa-  \\ntion, but that the reduced  sensitivity  of prices to soft infor- \\nmation  remains  more statistically  robust than the reduced  \\nsensitivity  to hard information.  \\nWe verify that our main conclusions  are robust to an \\nalternative  method  of estimating  differential  price discov-  \\nery. We use a regression  that is similar  to the unbiased-  \\nness regressions  used in Biais et al. (1999) , Barclay  and \\nHendershott  (2003) , and Van Kervel and Menkveld  (2019) . \\nSpeciﬁcally,  we regress  the long-window  log return (12 \\np.m. to 9:30 a.m. or 4 p.m. the next trading  day) onto a \\nshort-window  log return (12 p.m. to 4 p.m.) and the short- \\nwindow  log return interacted  with a dummy  “hacked”.  We \\npresent  these results in Table 4 . The interactions  are 0.130 \\nand 0.142, both statistically  signiﬁcant  at conventional  lev- \\nels, which suggests  that 13–14%  more of the total return \\nover the 21.5- or 28-hour  window  occurred  in the time \\nperiods  when the hackers  were trading.  We note that the economic  signiﬁcance  of this model is essentially  the same \\nas our main empirical  speciﬁcation.  \\n5.1. Robustness  \\nWe perform  a number  of tests to ensure that our main \\nresults are robust to alternative  modeling  or empirical  \\nchoices.  \\n5.1.1. Outliers  and functional  form \\nAs described  in Section  3 , we winsorize  the earnings  \\nsurprise  measure  at the 1st and 99th percentiles.  We next \\nverify that our main results are robust by winsorizing  at \\nthe 0.5th and 99.5th percentiles.  Moreover,  we use an al- \\nternative  estimation  approach  that relaxes  the assumption  \\nof a linear relationship  between  hard (earnings  surprise)  \\nor soft information  and returns  and also has the advantage  \\nof ensuring  our results are not driven by outliers.  More \\nspeciﬁcally,  we verify that our main results are robust to \\nusing a more ﬂexible  estimation  approach  in which we \\ndeﬁne observations  as falling into various  quintiles  of the \\nearnings  surprise  or soft information  distribution,  and per- \\nform a piecewise  estimation  to see if we observe  reduced  \\nreturn sensitivity  to high or low levels of hard or soft in- \\nformation  as measured  by the quintile  of the distribution.  \\nWe ﬁnd that our results are robust to this alternative  esti- \\nmation  methodology.  Tables A1, A2, and A3 in the Internet  \\nAppendix  present  the results of all of these tests. \\n5.1.2. Empirical  choices  to measure  soft information  \\nTo implement  the ElasticNet  algorithm,  we had to make \\nthree important  choices  with respect  to how to process  \\nthe text of the press releases:  how many words to keep \\nfrom each press release  and the maximum  and minimum  \\nfrequency  thresholds  to keep individual  words (400, 0.5% \\n1176 ', metadata={'source': 'hacking_prices.pdf', 'page': 14}),\n",

We provide  a plot that shows our estimates  of the \\nrevelation  of soft information  are stable across a number  \\nof alternative  implementation  choices  that we could have \\nmade in Figure A2 of the Internet  Appendix.  \\n5.1.3. Robustness  to removing  large cases \\nUS regulators  allege that many traders  were not lo- \\ncated within American  legal jurisdiction  and, therefore,  \\nmany more instances  of informed  trading  occurred  than \\nthose events that formed  the basis of the enforcement  ac- \\ntions that we used to study trading  behavior.  As such, our \\nmain empirical  speciﬁcation  should capture  the effect of \\nthe traders  that were apprehended  as well as those that \\nwere not. However,  we verify that our main results remain  \\nrobust when removing  those 724 cases who were part of \\nthe US enforcement  actions  to verify that our main re- \\nsults are not simply capturing  a relatively  small number  \\nof events.  As Internet  Appendix  Tables A4 and A5 show, \\nour results are similar  when the prosecuted  cases are ex- \\ncluded,  suggesting  the scheme  was indeed  widespread  in \\nmagnitude.  \\n5.2. Signal strength  and price discovery  \\nWe now examine  whether  the signal strength  inter- \\nacts with the strength  of price revelation.  While the as- \\nsumption  of canonical  models  of informed  trading  such \\nas Kyle (1985) assume  informed  traders  know the fun- \\ndamental  value of the asset, which causes them to trade \\nmost aggressively  when the difference  between  the ob- \\nserved and fundamental  prices are largest,  the hackers  \\nonly had a signal about the future value of the assets. \\nOther models  of trading  such as Kim and Verrecchia  (1991, \\n1997) , Kandel  and Pearson  (1995) , and Banerjee  and Kre- \\nmer (2010) are closest to the informed  traders  involved  in \\nthe scheme.  In such models,  information  precision  about \\nfundamentals  further  determines  the degree of trade ag- \\ngressiveness  by insiders.  Such key canonical  characteristics  \\nof microstructure  models  have largely been untested  be- \\ncause testing them requires  the researcher  to have a cross- \\nsection of events that investors  could have traded on but \\ndid not, as well as a control  group of stocks that were not \\nsubject  to potential  informed  trading.  Unfortunately,  we \\ncannot directly  examine  the individual  trades of the hack- \\ners because  our effort s to acquire  this information  have \\nbeen unsuccessful,  so our tests focus on the strength  of \\nprice revelation.  Effectively,  we are assuming  that higher \\nprice revelation  prior to earnings  announcements  reﬂects  \\na higher amount  of informed  trading  by the hackers.  \\nTo examine  how the signal strength  interacts  with \\nthe strength  of price discovery,  we reestimate  regressions  \\nspeciﬁed  in Eqs. (2) and (3) for announcements  with high \\n(above median)  and low (below  median)  values of soft \\ninformation  and for announcements  with high and low \\nearnings  surprises,  respectively.  That is to say, we exam- \\nine whether  price revelation  of hard (soft) information  was stronger  when the magnitude  of the “other” signal  was \\nlarger. Panel A of Table 5 examines  the revelation  of the \\nearnings  surprise  in the high and low soft information  \\nsample.  Columns  (1)–(2)  suggest  the return responsiveness  \\nto earnings  surprises  for announcements  with high abso- \\nlute soft information  declined  by 18.7% ( = 0.329/1.763)  (sta- \\ntistically  signiﬁcant  at the 5% level), while Columns  (3)–\\n(4) suggest  no statistically  signiﬁcant  change  in return re- \\nsponsiveness  to earnings  surprises  for events with smaller  \\namounts  of soft information.  \\nPanel B presents  the results of the revelation  of soft \\ninformation  in the sample  of high and low earnings  sur- \\nprises. Columns  (1)–(2)  show the return responsiveness  to \\nits soft information  for announcements  with high absolute  \\nearnings  surprises  declined  by 20.2% ( = 0.33/1.63)  (statis-  \\ntically signiﬁcant  at the 5% level), while columns  (3)–(4)  \\nsuggest  no statistically  signiﬁcant  change  in return respon-  \\nsiveness  to soft information  for events with smaller  earn- \\nings surprises.  Collectively,  these results suggest  informed  \\ntraders  trade more aggressively  when their information  is \\na more precise  signal about fundamental  value, resulting  in \\nhigher revelation  of fundamental  information.  \\n6. Did liquidity  providers  react to the informed  \\ntrading?  \\nWe now examine  our ﬁnal research  question:  did liq- \\nuidity providers  react to the increase  in informed  trading  \\nby charging  higher spreads?  A number  of theoretical  stud- \\nies model the behavior  of informed  investors  and unin- \\nformed  market  makers  (e.g., Glosten  and Milgrom,  1985; \\nKyle, 1985; Easley and O’Hara,  1992; Collin-Dufresne  and \\nFos, 2016 ). A common  theme of these models  is that if \\nmarket  makers  were to observe  an increase  in informed  \\ntrading  activity  then they would respond  by widening  \\nspreads  or decreasing  market  depth. Taking this behavior  \\nas given, informed  traders  strategically  split or time their \\ntrades when possible  to avoid revealing  themselves  to mar- \\nket makers.  Existing  research  that “tests” models  of in- \\nformed  trading  focuses  its empirical  tests on how informed  \\ntraders  structure  their trades when trying to proﬁt from \\ntheir information  (e.g., Koudijs,  2015; Kacperczyk  and Pag- \\nnotta, 2021; Shkilko,  2018; Bolandnazar  et al., 2020 ). How- \\never, to our knowledge,  existing  research  has not exam- \\nined the ability of market makers  to respond  to increased  \\ninformed  trading  volume,  a critical  assumption  for these \\nmodels.  14 Testing  this assumption  is challenging  because  \\nresearchers  require  an empirical  setting  such as ours in \\nwhich informed  investors  faced substantial  constraints  on \\ntheir ability to strategically  split their trades. The short \\nwindow  of time between  when the hackers  accessed  up- \\ncoming  press releases  and their prescheduled  release  to ﬁ- \\nnancial  markets  provides  such a setting.  \\nWe begin by examining  whether  market  makers  could \\nplausibly  have detected  a sharp increase  in trading  activ- \\n14 Collin-Dufresne  et al. (2021) suggest that informed  trading in options \\nmarkets causes option spreads to widen, to our knowledge  no one has \\nshown they can also widen in the underlying  market. \\n1177 ', metadata={'source': 'hacking_prices.pdf', 'page': 15}),\n",

We identify  the three closest \\nmatches  based on earnings  surprise  and on the stock re- \\nturn from 12 p.m. to the next day open. We then calculate  \\nthe abnormal  log equity volume  and log option volume  for \\neach minute  for each ﬁrm as the difference  between  the \\nlog volume  observed  at time tminus the log of the aver- \\nage volume  for the same minute  in the past 21 days.

We ﬁrst examine  which of \\nthese measures  are demonstrably  higher when the hack- \\ners were likely to be trading  in order to verify that liq- \\nuidity providers  could have reacted  to a measure  of or- \\nder ﬂow as suggested  by theory (e.g., Glosten  and Mil- \\ngrom, 1985; Easley and O’Hara,  1992 ). We then examine  \\nwhether  liquidity  providers  reacted  by studying  whether  \\nquoted  spreads,  effective  spreads,  realized  spreads,  and \\nprice impact  increased  when the hackers  had access to \\nnon-public  information.  When designing  these tests, we \\nuse the fact that press releases  were often uploaded  in the \\nlate morning  or early afternoon  to the newswire  servers,  \\nand the hackers  typically  only began trading  in the after- \\nnoon, which allows us to use the morning  as a second  \\ntype of placebo  test.

Second,  liquidity  providers  could be engaging  in dynamic  \\ninventory  control.  For example,  Ho and Stoll (1981) and \\nHendershott  and Menkveld  (2014) suggest  that liquidity  \\nproviders  generally  manage  inventory  risk associated  with \\nlarge buy/sell  pressure  by adjusting  quotes to steer vol- \\nume traﬃc towards  reverting  their inventory  to the desired  \\nlevel ( Menkveld,  2013 ). \\nColumns  (5)–(8)  examine  which measures  of spreads  \\nincrease  when 1 [ Hacked ] i,t is equal to one. We ﬁnd that ef- \\nfective spreads  increased  by 3% of a standard  deviation  \\nduring periods  when a ﬁrm’s newswire  had been hacked.  \\nWe decompose  this increase  in effective  spread into two \\ncomponents:  a realized  spread component  and a price im- \\npact component.  We ﬁnd this increase  in effective  spread \\ncomes from an increase  in the realized  spread rather than \\nfrom a direct price impact  of each trade.

We then reestimate  Eq. (4) for each \\npercentile  for each measure.  \\nWe summarize  the results of this estimation  in Fig. 7 , \\nwhere we plot the point estimate  and conﬁdence  intervals  \\nfor each percentile  for the morning  and the afternoon  for \\neach dependent  variable.  Panel A presents  the results for \\neffective  spreads.  The point estimates  are always positive  \\nand 42% are statistically  signiﬁcant  at the ﬁve-percent  level \\nin the afternoon.  None of the point estimates  are statisti-  \\ncally signiﬁcant  in the morning.  When we look at the two \\ncomponents  of the effective  spread in panels B and C, (the \\nrealized  spread and the price impact),  respectively,  the av- \\nerage results in Table 6 become  easier to understand.  In \\nthe afternoon,  the realized  spread is statistically  positive  at \\nthe ﬁve-percent  level above the 70th percentile  and is sta- \\ntistically  negative  below the 6th percentile,  while the price \\nimpact  is only statistically  positive  above the 91st per- \\n19 For early evidence  on intraday seasonality,  see McInish and \\nWood (1992) and Wood et al. (1985) . centile and is negative  below the 24th percentile.  The neg- \\native shift in the left part of the distribution  for price im- \\npact is likely either a consequence  of inventory  risk man- \\nagement  by liquidity  providers  or of informed  trading  exe- \\ncuted using limit orders,  which would be measured  as neg- \\native price impact  when estimated  with conventional  mea- \\nsures of price impact.  These results further  conﬁrm  that \\nsome individual  trades had higher price impact,  which liq- \\nuidity providers  may have been able to observe  and which \\nmay have led them to increase  the spreads  they charge to \\ntraders.  We ﬁnd no robust patterns  in the morning  for ei- \\nther variable  and note that the standard  errors are gener- \\nally larger in the morning,  particularly  for the larger per- \\ncentiles.  Collectively,  these results provide  guidance  for fu- \\nture research  using these illiquidity  measures  to proxy the \\ndegree of insider  trading.  We recommend  researchers  fur- \\nther examine  the change  in the distribution  of these mea- \\nsures, as the mean effect can be subsumed  by the fact that \\ninsider  trading  can occur through  market  and limit orders \\n( Kaniel and Liu, 2006; Baruch  et al., 2017 ). \\n7. Conclusion  \\nWe use a series of successful  hacks on newswire  \\nproviders  when a group of traders  illegally  accessed  press \\nreleases  several  hours before their pre-scheduled  distribu-  \\ntion to ﬁnancial  markets  to study how informed  traders  \\nprocess  ﬁnancial  information  and how eﬃciently  markets  \\nincorporate  private  information  into prices. This empiri-  \\ncal setting  allows us to use a differences-in-differences  \\nmethodology  to identify  plausibly  exogenous  variation  in \\nthe information  set of a group of traders.  \\nWe ﬁrst examine  which types of signal best explained  \\nthe hackers’  trading  decisions.  We quantify  the soft (or \\nqualitative)  information  contained  in the press releases  us- \\ning machine  learning  techniques  and compute  the earn- \\nings surprise  to quantify  the hard (or quantitative)  infor- \\nmation  in the press releases.  We ﬁnd that both types of \\nsignal were important  and complementary  determinants  \\nof the hacker’s  trading  decisions—the  hackers  were most \\nlikely to trade on earnings  announcements  for which there \\nwere correlated  signals  that were more extreme  in mag- \\nnitude.  These choices  were proﬁtable.  The hackers’  trades \\nwere associated  with much larger changes  in fundamen-  \\ntal value once the news was publicly  released  than other \\ntrades they could have made. \\nWe next examine  how much of the information  was re- \\nvealed by the hackers’  trading.  We ﬁnd that overnight  re- \\nturns (after the earnings  releases  became  public)  were 15% \\nless responsive  to both the hard and soft information  when \\nthe hackers  had early access to the press releases.  We ﬁnd \\nthis reduced  sensitivity  is strongest  for earnings  announce-  \\nments for which the hard or soft information  contained  in \\nthe press release  were the most extreme,  suggesting  the \\nhackers  traded most aggressively  on signals  that were the \\nmost precise.  \\nFinally,  we examine  whether  market  makers  can de- \\ntect and respond  to sharp increases  in informed  trading.  \\nWe ﬁnd that equity volume,  equity turnover,  and option \\nvolume  were signiﬁcantly  higher in stocks for which the \\ninformed  traders  had access to upcoming  earnings  news. \\n1182 ', metadata={'source': 'hacking_prices.pdf', 'page': 20}),\n",
